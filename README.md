# shortlang-brainfuck
A **beta grade**, brainfuck interpreter written in the [ShortLang](https://github.com/ShortLang/ShortLang), a hobbyist code golfing language. It lacks proper testing and breaks with *some* programs (known broken programs): 
- [brainfuck uwufier](https://github.com/lasermtv07/brainfuck-uwufier)
- [e.bf](https://www.brainfuck.org/)

However other than that, it works. I also managed to get some more complex programs *(such as [my table generator](https://github.com/lasermtv07/brainfuck-table))* running, so thats cool.<br>
Here, enjoy a screenshot:

Thats all
